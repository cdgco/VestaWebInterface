## If Automatic Installation was used

NOTE: Upgrading from v1.0.1 or older requires a [clean installation](auto-install).

#### Step 1:
Enter the web directory of your VWI Installation.

Example:
```shell
cd /home/admin/web/mydomain.com/public_html/
```
#### Step 2:
Run the automatic upgrader.

bash <(curl -s https://cdgco.github.io/upfull)
```
Upgrade Complete
