## Interakt Integration

The Interakt integration with VWI allows you to offer customer support and enable user management and tracking within your control panel.

### Interakt Setup

#### Step 1:
From the [Interakt control panel](https://app.interakt.co/), create a [new project](https://app.interakt.co/projects/new), entering your VWI URL as the project URL.

#### Step 2
From the API section of your project settings, copy the Interakt APP ID and enter it into your VWI config. (Read the [Web Based Config](web-config#optional-integrations) or [Manual Config](manual-config#integrations) pages for info on how to do this.)

#### Step 3 (Optional):

Copy the Interakt API Key and enter it into your VWI config to enable user management. (Read the [Web Based Config](web-config#optional-integrations) or [Manual Config](manual-config#integrations) pages for info on how to do this.) 

By enabling user management, Interakt will integrate with the VWI API and store the following data, allowing you to customize apps and better support users:
- First / Last Name
- Username
- Email Address
- Account Plan
- Account Status
- Date Joined

All Done! You can now enable / disable and customize any apps such as live chat, leads, helpdesk and more from Interakt and all changes will affect your VWI site.
