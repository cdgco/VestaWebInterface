* Server with root access and VestaCP installed.
* Web server with php and php-curl installed (Does not have to be powered by VestaCP)

## Install

#### Method 1

1. Run the command `bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/vbjO7)` while inside of the desired web directory on the VestaCP machine.
2. Visit the url of the web directory to complete configuration.
3. Chmod 'includes' folder to 755 (`chmod 755 includes`) after configuration is complete.

#### Method 2

1. Download and extract the latest release to a web server (Does not have to be running VestaCP).
2. Chmod 'includes' folder to 777 (`chmod 777 includes`).
3. Run the command `bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/vbjOd)` on your vesta server to install the backend files.
4. Visit the url of the web directory to complete configuration.
5. Chmod 'includes' folder to 755 (`chmod 755 includes`) after configuration is complete.

Note: If you cannot chmod files, manually configure the includes/config-example.php file as in step 3 of method 3.


#### Method 3

1. Download and extract the latest release to a web server (Does not have to be running VestaCP).
2. Copy the contents of the 'install/web' folder in the release to the '/usr/local/vesta/web' directory of your vesta server.
3. Edit the 'includes/config-example.php' file and rename it to config.php.

## What method should I use?

* Method 1 is used to install VWI automatically if the frontend is on the same server as VestaCP.
* Method 2 is used to intsall the VWI frontend manually and the backend automatically if the frontend is not hosted by a VestaCP server. 
* Method 3 is used to install VWI manually in case of any errors or other circumstances with other installation methods.
